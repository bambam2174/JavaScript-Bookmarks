# Javascript Boomarks

Over the years I've developed let's call them ***dynamic bookmarks*** Ã  la 
`javascript:alert(location.href)`
or
`javascript:window.open( 'https://bambam2174.github.io', '_blank');`

## TinyURL.js / TinyURL-blank.js
These two I use the most often
When you click them the browser makes a request to TinyURL.com with the current page's URL.
[TinyURL](https://tinyurl.com/create.php?url=bambam2174.github.io)
You end up on ***https://tinyurl.com/app/create*** where you can copy the shortened URL
